A todo list application built with Python and Flask to demonstrate how to
build a RESTful API using flask and python.

This is only a basic app that does nothing much other than provide urls via
which you can query the server and get tasks in the in-memory database, post
a task, update a task and delete a task. It is based on the tutorial
Designing a RESTful API with Python and Flask by Miguel Grinberg.
